## Lesson 2.6 - Object Oriented PHP - Class Constants


### Constants

> Constants are immutable meaning that you cannot change the value once's is defined 
> we define constants similar to properties, but we follow standard to keep
> all constant names uppercase and use underscores as the separator.

> We don't need to have the instance of the class to access the class constance.
