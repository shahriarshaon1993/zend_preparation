# Lesson 1.1 - Installation & Webservers

## What is Web Server?

> When talking about web servers you could either refer to hardware or software or both hardware and software together. a web server on the hardware is just a computer that stores the web server software source code and some other stuff. a web server can process incoming requests using different protocols typically it's the HTTP protocol which is the protocol used by the browser to view the web pages. a web server can host either a single or multiple websites on the same server using the same resource this is done by something called virtual hosts where the single web server is able to allocate and share resources across multiple websites.

## What is Apache?

> Apache HTTP Server Project is an open-source web server software that operates across various operating systems, including Windows and UNIX. That means its software is free to use and edit, with developers continually working to improve the project:

> It’s important to understand that Apache is not the server itself. Web servers are computers that store your site’s files and process requests from visitors’ browsers. These servers use software (such as Apache or NGINX) to receive requests, retrieve information, and serve it to users.

## What is NGINX?

> NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. It started out as a web server designed for maximum performance and stability. In addition to its HTTP server capabilities, NGINX can also function as a proxy server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
