## Lesson 2.0 - Intro to Object-Oriented Programming

### Class vs Object

> Class is blueprint and an Object is something that you create or build from 
> that blueprint you could have many object of the same class but each of those 
> objects can be different.

> Let's take a house as an example the blueprint of the house would be your class
> and the house itself would be the object you could have multiple houses based on
> the same blueprint whit slight differences they can have different paint colors
> they can have different layouts and so on.

> In other word objects are simply instances of the classes.

> The main advantage of object-oriented programming is the ability to structure
> your code in a better way that is easier to maintain test extend debug and so on.

### Why OOP?

> - Better Code Structure
> - Easier To Maintain
> - Modular & Extendable
> - Polymorphism Flexibility
> - On Demand

### OOP principles:

> Object-oriented programming has four main principles:
> - Encapsulation
> - Abstraction
> - Inheritance
> - Polymorphism
