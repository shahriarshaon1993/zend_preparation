## Lesson 3.13: How to Send Email in PHP - Symfony Mailer - Email Protocols - Mailhog Setup

### Email Protocols:
- SMTP = Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (Outbound Emails)
- IMAP = Post Office Protocol (V3) - (Inbound Emails)
- POP3 = Internet Message Access Protocol - (Inbound Emails)

> IMAP/POP3 are protocols that are used for retrieving or receiving emails.

```text
IMAP vs POP3: The difference is that IMAP offers more features than POP3 for
example POP3 by default deletes the email from the server after it retrieves
it while IMAP on the other hand does not delete the email on the server and
allows it to be synced across multiple client so the emails with IMAP are
stored on the server.
