## Lesson 3.10: PHP Attributes - Simple Router With Attributes

### PHP Attributes

> Attributes offer the ability to add structured, machine-readable 
> metadata information on declarations in code: Classes, methods, 
> functions, parameters, properties and class constants can be the 
> target of an attribute. The metadata defined by attributes can then
> be inspected at runtime using the Reflection APIs. Attributes could
> therefore be thought of as a configuration language embedded directly
> into code.
