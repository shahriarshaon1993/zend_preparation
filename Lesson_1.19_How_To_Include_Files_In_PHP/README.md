## Lesson 1.19 - PHP Return, Declare & Tickable Statements

### Return:

> return returns program control to the calling module. Execution resumes
> at the expression following the called module's invocation.

> If called from within a function, the return statement immediately ends 
> execution of the current function, and returns its argument as the value 
> of the function call. return also ends the execution of an eval() statement 
> or script file.

> Note: Note that since return is a language construct and not a function, the 
> parentheses surrounding its argument are not required and their use is discouraged.

### Declare:

```php
declare(strict_types=1);
```
